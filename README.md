# Arcade Table
My take of the classic arcade table (cabinet). Constructed completely by hand with 13mm MDF, glue and a lots of screws. Complete with 4:3 aspect ratio 19 Inch TFT Monitor, thumping 2x50 Watt Class-D Power Amplified and authentic controls.

# Warning
This design has not been compliance tested and will not be. Mains power is feed directly into the cabinet and can be DANGEROUS or LIFE THREATING. I take no personal responsibility liability should you injur or kill yourself should you decide to copy this design and build a cabinet yourself. I accept no responsibility for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this design and its components. IT IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!

# Overview
To allow for FLASH based Kickstart images to be mapped in the same address space as existing ROM based kickstarts without the need to remove the existing ROM. This design is targeting an accelerated A500(+) system which also require a CPU relocation.

### Appearance

### Known Issues And Pending Items
As this design is still in-the-making, the following items are pending:

1. PCB Layout and schematic finalisation. Pinning for CPLD is open to allow for routing.
2. CPLD logic verification. Currently fitted to a XC9572XL, however target device is XC9536XL.
3. Testing.
